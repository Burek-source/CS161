/*

Creating Variables

Write a Java program that:

1. Declares an integer, called num1, and sets its value to be 12.
2. Declares a double, called num2, and sets its value to be 123.4.
3. Declares a character variable, called letter, and sets its value to be 'c'.
4. Prints each initialised variable on a new line.

You must not use print statements to print out 12, 123.4 or c, but use them 
to print out the variables using their names.

NOTE: You must use the variable names and values given.

Sample output

12
123.4
c

        char letter = 'c';

        System.out.println(num1);
        System.out.println(num2);
        System.out.println(letter);
